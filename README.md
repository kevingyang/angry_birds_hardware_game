## Project title
Angry Nerds

## Team members
Selena Sun, Kevin Yang, James Zheng

## Project description


## Member contribution
A short description of the work performed by each member of the team.

Kevin: set up graphics (plotting trajectory on-screen with force and angle measurements with kinematics and drawing images of staff members on-screen), set up game logic (with countdown, keyboard, graphics, and difficulty selection components)

James: set up and programmed force-sensing resistor along with ADC, implemented/tested function for generating random target, various alterations to combine hardware with software

Selena: sourced and assembled hardware (ie., making extension wires, designing integrated sensor system), designed/tested/implemented IMU processing sequence (with James's help!)

If your submission incorporates external contributions such as adopting 
someone else's code or circuit into your project, be sure to clearly 
delineate what portion of the work was derivative and what portion is 
your original work.

## Self-evaluation
How well was your team able to execute on the plan in your proposal?  
Any trying or heroic moments you would like to share? Of what are you particularly proud: the effort you put into it? the end product? 
the process you followed? what you learned along the way? Tell us about it!

Overall, our team was able to accomplish our goal of replicating an Angry Birds-esque game using a real slingshot. Heroic moments include spending
days on implementing an amazing suite of graphics functions (Kevin), setting up the slingshot and a majority of the hardware (Selena), and staying
up the night before project presentations to integrate hardware with software (James and Selena). We were able to learn the difficulties that come
with using sensors such as IMUs and force-sensing resistors, the difficulties that go into combining hardware with software, as well as the
workflow of using Git and Github to code collaboratively.
