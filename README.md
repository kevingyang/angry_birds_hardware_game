## Project title
Angry Nerds

## Team members
Selena Sun, Kevin Yang, James Zheng

## Project description
Our project will be an arcade-like Angry Birds game, where the player uses a physical slingshot to control the force and trajectory of the bird and hit a target on screen! Depending on the angle and force with which the player pulls back the bird on the slingshot, as measured by an inertial measurement unit and a force-sensing resistor, the birdâ€™s trajectory will be modified and plotted with the graphics library.

## Member contribution
A short description of the work performed by each member of the team.

Kevin: set up graphics (plotting trajectory on-screen with force and angle measurements with kinematics and drawing images of staff members on-screen), set up game logic (with countdown, keyboard, graphics, and difficulty selection components)

James: set up and programmed force-sensing resistor along with ADC, implemented/tested function for generating random target, various alterations to combine hardware with software

Selena: sourced and assembled hardware (ie., making extension wires, designing integrated sensor system), designed/tested/implemented IMU processing sequence (with James's help!)
