## Project description
Our project will be an arcade-like Angry Birds game, where the player uses a physical slingshot to control the trajectory of the bird and hit a target on screen! Depending on the angle and force with which the player pulls back the bird on the slingshot, the birdâ€™s trajectory will be modified and plotted with the graphics library.

## Hardware, budget
Adafruit LSM6DS33 6-DoF Accel + Gyro IMU
CS107E IMU drivers

## Major tasks, member responsibilities
Kevin: Graphics for rendering trajectory of bird, game logic (determining whether the bird hits a target)
James: Some of hardware assembly, some of graphics (target)
Selena: Most of hardware assembly, ensure smooth interface with software

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
We plan to have all of the hardware assembled and the basics graphics code written. From there, we'll optimize the graphics and ensure smooth interfacing between hardware and software components.

## Resources needed, issues
Guidance in potentially using the IMU to sense relative distance (between anchor point and sling point)
